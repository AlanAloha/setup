Coding Challenge
================

The following document is a coding challenge. Complete as many of the programs
as possible within a 20 minute time limit. You are not allowed to use any
previous code. Each program you complete gives you 1 point. Your goal is to get
as many points as possible.

## Hello World ##

Write a program the prints "Hello World".

## FizzBuzz ##

Print the numbers from 1-100 except

+ If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
+ If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
+ If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

## Hello Again ##

Write a program the runs your hello world program from above, captures its
output and appends ", again!" at the end. The output should be one line.

## Sequence Coverage ##

Simulate re-sequencing a genome. How much of a genome is not sequenced at 3x
coverage? The value of 3x must be a command line parameter.

## Hydropathy ##

Write a program that computes the local hydropathy of a sequence. There must be
parameters for window size and the sequence. You may use any Kyte-Doolittle or
any other hydropathy scale. The output should be tabular, with columns for
position and hydropathy.

## Codon Usage ##

Write a program that reports the codon usage for a file of coding sequences.

## Birthday Paradox ##

Write a simulation of the birthday paradox. That is, given a classroom of size
X, when is the probability of two people sharing the same birthday greater than
50%.

## FASTA File ##

Write a function to read FASTA files and put it in a library.

## Position Weight Matrix ##

Given a FASTA file of sequences, create a representative PWM. Use your library
file from abov.

## Entropy Filter ##

Write a complexity filter for nucleotide sequences. There must be command line
parameters for the sequence file, window size, and entropy cutoff. The program
must be executable from anywhere on your computer.
