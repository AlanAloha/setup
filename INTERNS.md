Interns
=======

How to get started as an intern in the Korf lab.

## Programming ##

In order to be useful in the lab, you need a minimum level of Unix and Python
experience. Try the `CHALLENGE.md` located in this same repository. It's not
expected that you can complete all of the programs in 60 minutes, but you
should be able to write all of the programs eventually. If you can't write
those, then you should brush up on your Unix/Python programming from the MCB185
course that I teach. The materials are also on GitHub.

After completing MCB185 and the CHALLENGE, I also like students to tackle a
more interesting program so that we can discuss the philosophy or programming.

+ The "overlap problem"
+ Smith-Waterman or Viterbi

## Meetings ##

You're expected to go to the general lab meeting as well as whatever subgroups
you belong to.

You're also expected to meet with the PI from time to time. You can schedule
these using Calendly. See the pinned announcement in Slack.
