Interns
=======

How to get started as an intern in the Korf lab.

Programming
-----------

In order to be useful in the lab, you need a minimum level of Unix and Python
experience. Try the `CHALLENGE.md` located in this same repository. It's not
expected that you can complete all of the programs in 60 minutes, but you
should be able to write all of the programs. If you're new to programming, your
first task is to learn Unix and Python. Check out the latest version of the
MCB185 course I teach (it's on GitHub).

After completing MCB185 and the `CHALLENGE.md`, I also like students to tackle
a more interesting program so that we can discuss development philosophy. This
is usually the "overlap problem" and possibly some dynamic programming like
Smith-Waterman or Viterbi.

Meetings
--------

You're expected to go to the general lab meeting as well as whatever subgroups
you belong to.

You're also expected to meet with the PI from time to time. You can schedule
these using Calendly. See the pinned announcement in Slack.

Collaboration
-------------

Science rewards collaboration and proactivity. Most of your education has
expected you to work on you own to compete with your classmates on memorizing
material that has a known answer. That's not the way science works in the real
world. You have to work with other people on things that are unknown and there
are no metrics for success. If you hide under a rock, I will not turn it over
to find you. It's up to you to make things happen.

+ Ask others for help
+ Ask to join others
+ Ask others if they want to join you
+ Meet people more than 50% of the way
