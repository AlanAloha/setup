Interns
=======

How to get started as an intern in the Korf lab.

Programming
-----------

In order to be useful in the lab, you need a minimum level of programming
experience. This includes a mixture of Unix, Python, and Git. You will
eventually need to pass the `EXAM.md` located in this same repository. But if
you're new to programming that will be impossible. Don't worry, we all start
from zero.

Meetings
--------

You're expected to go to the general lab meeting as well as whatever subgroups
you belong to.

You're also expected to meet with the PI from time to time. You can schedule
these using Calendly. See the pinned announcement in Slack.

Collaboration
-------------

Science rewards collaboration and proactivity. Most of your education has
expected you to work on you own to compete with your classmates on memorizing
material that has a known answer. That's not the way science works in the real
world. You have to work with other people on things that are unknown and there
are no metrics for success. If you hide under a rock, I will not turn it over
to find you. It's up to you to make things happen.

+ Ask others for help
+ Ask to join others
+ Ask others if they want to join you
+ Meet people more than 50% of the way
