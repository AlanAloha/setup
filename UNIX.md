Critical Unix/Linux
===================

## Login Customization ##

You should modify your login script

+ Make `ls` do `ls -F` always
+ Make an alias to log into favorite servers
+ Change enviornment variables
	+ Don't use your actual $HOME on cluster
	+ Add your $HOME/bin to your path
	+ Set $PYTHONLIB for your local libraries

## Cluster ##

+ Use `nice` if you're using a lot of resources
+ Use `top` or `htop` to monitor resources
+ Use ^C to kill a job in the foreground
+ Use ^Z to sleep a job in the foreground
+ Use `fg` to start a sleeping job in the foreground
+ Use `bg` to start a sleeping job in the background
+ Use `ps` to show jobs here or `ps -lu <username` to show all your jobs
+ Use `kill -9 <jobid>` to kill a job
